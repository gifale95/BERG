# Brain Encoding Response Generator (BERG)

The **Brain Encoding Response Generator (BERG)** is a resource consisting of of multiple pre-trained encoding models of the brain and an accompanying Python package to generate accurate in silico neural responses to arbitrary stimuli with just a few lines of code.

In silico neural responses from encoding models increasingly resemble in vivo responses recorded from real brains, enabling the novel research paradigm of in silico neuroscience. In silico neural responses are quick and cheap to generate, allowing researchers to explore and test scientific hypotheses across vastly larger solution spaces than possible in vivo. Novel findings from large-scale in silico experimentation are then validated through targeted small-scale in vivo data collection, in this way optimizing research resources. Thus, in silico neuroscience scales beyond what is possible with in vivo data, and democratizes research across groups with diverse data collection infrastructure and resources. To catalyze this emerging research paradigm, we introduce the Brain Encoding Response Generator (BERG), a resource consisting of multiple pre-trained encoding models of the brain and an accompanying Python package to generate accurate in silico neural responses to arbitrary stimuli with just a few lines of code. BERG includes a growing, well documented library of encoding models trained on different neural data acquisition modalities, datasets, subjects, stimulation types, and brain areas, offering broad versatility for addressing a wide range of research questions through in silico neuroscience.

For additional information on BERG, you can check out our [documentation][documentation].

### ‚ú® BERG functions

#### üîπ Initialize the BERG object

To use `BERG`'s functions, you first need to import `BERG` and create a `berg_object`.

```python
from berg import BERG

# Initialize BERG with the path to the toolkit
berg = BERG(berg_dir="path/to/brain-encoding-response-generator")
```
#### üîπ Generate in silico neural responses to stimuli

Step 1: Load an encoding model of your choice using the `get_encoding_model` function.

```python
# Load an example fMRI encoding model
fmri_model = berg.get_encoding_model("fmri-nsd-fwrf", 
                                     subject=1,
                                     selection={"roi": "V1"},
                                     device="cpu")

# Load an example EEG encoding model
eeg_model = berg.get_encoding_model("eeg-things_eeg_2-vit_b_32",
                                    subject=1,
                                    device="auto")

```

Step 2: Generate in silico neural responses to stimuli using the `encode` function.

```python
# Encode fMRI responses to images with metadata
insilico_fmri, insilico_fmri_metadata = berg.encode(fmri_model,
                                                   images,
                                                   return_metadata=True)  # if needed

# Encode EEG responses to images without metadata
insilico_eeg = berg.encode(eeg_model,
                          images)
```

**Example Application - Relational Neural Control (RNC):**

We used BERG to develop [Relational Neural Control](https://github.com/gifale95/RNC), a neural control algorithm to move from an atomistic understanding of visual cortical areas (i.e., What does each area represent?) to a network-level understanding (i.e., What is the relationship between representations in different areas?). Through RNC we discovered controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Following are RNC tutorials based on in silico fMRI responses generated through BERG:
